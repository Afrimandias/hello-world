Intro to GitHub

Hi everyone,

Very excited to join this comunity.
My hope is that this journey gets me closer to my goal : 
Create a new cryptocurrency that would be an alternative to the current Franc CFA (symbols XOF and XAF) used in French-speaking Western Africa
Which is pegged to the Euro and partly controlled by the French Bank
I'm looking forward to discussing this project with anyone interested or currious.
Cheers!!
